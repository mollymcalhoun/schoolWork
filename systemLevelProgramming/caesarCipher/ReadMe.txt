caesarDecrypt.c takes a file containing text that has been encypted with a Caesar cipher as a command line argument (in this case text.one.encrypt), finds the decryption key based on the most frequent letter in the encrypted text, then decodes and prints the text to stdout.

The file ceaser.c was provided by the instructor as a basis to work backwards from.
