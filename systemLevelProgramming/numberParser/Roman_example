Ave, Marcelus
Decimate means to take one tenth and kill them. 
Tiberius took nine tenths and the one tenth left was outnumbered 8 to 3 by the Germanii.
4 other generals repeated his mistake and the 2  4 5 6  legions were destroyed.
 Only legion 3 and 7 survived along with cohorts 2 5 8 of legion 7 
The 1 legion that did best was not decimated.
Hope that you like this barbarious Germanic language because 
we'll all be using it soon.

Hail Caeser
